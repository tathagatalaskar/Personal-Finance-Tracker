# 💸 Pay-Cycle Finance Tracker (Pro)

> **A Smart Financial Forecasting Tool built with Python & SQLite**

Most budget apps fail because they strictly follow calendar months. This tool is built for the real world—tracking your money from **paycheck to paycheck**. It doesn't just record what you spent; it uses a **Predictive Burn-Rate Algorithm** to tell you exactly how many days your money will last.
